1-) Self hosting images
  a-) support upload of files related (at the db) with answer/questions to the backend (with those error handling issues)
  b-) develop a new widget for our markdown editor to upload images
  c-) support deletion of files 


2-) Deletion of questions/answers
  a-) owners should be capable of deleting questions/answers as long as there are no answers/comments (in case of questions) or comments (in case of answers) associated   
  b-) solr indexes should be updated after a question/answer being deleted
  c-) the images related with that question/answer should be removed from the FS
  d) moderators or admins should be capable to delete entire threads (questions with answers) 


3-) Local avatars
  a-) create an API in User class to set/get an image and store it on the FS
  b-) fallback to gravatar if a image does not exist
  c-) scale images retrieved from avatar provider
  d-) provide an user interface to upload images

4-) Users should be capable to subscribe to all questions and receive email updates (I'll create a new field on the User class and a checkbox in the user form)

5a) make the permission rule values (i.e. PermissionRulesConstants) configurable with a properties file
